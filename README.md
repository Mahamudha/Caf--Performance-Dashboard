### 2. **Product Category Distribution**  
How are transactions distributed across different product categories (e.g., coffee, food, snacks)?

### 3. **Weekly Transaction Trends**  
What are the weekly transaction trends? Which days of the week show the highest and lowest number of sales?

### 4. **Year-over-Year Revenue Comparison**  
What is the year-over-year revenue comparison? Use pie charts or other visuals to show growth.
